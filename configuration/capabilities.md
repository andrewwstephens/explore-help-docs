* Polarimetry:  Currently only available using visiting instruments.

* Coronagraphy:  Block the light from a bright object to observe a nearby faint object
([GPI](https://www.gemini.edu/instrumentation/gpi) or [NIFS](https://www.gemini.edu/instrumentation/nifs))

* Speckle:  Diffraction-limited optical imaging over a small field
