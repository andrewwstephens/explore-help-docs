# Water Vapor

Specify the maximum **on-source** precipitable water vapor for your observation, keeping in mind that observations at wavelengths shortward of 1.3 microns are negligibly affected by water vapor.

|             | Gemini North | Gemini South
---           | :---:        | :---:
**Very Dry**  | < 1.0 mm     | < 2.3 mm
**Dry**       | < 1.6 mm     | < 4.3 mm
**Median**    | < 3.0 mm     | < 7.6 mm
**Wet**       | ~ 5.0 mm     | ~ 10.0 mm

The water vapor is unconstrained for "Wet" conditions but the ITC uses the values in the table for its calculations.

Gemini South does not currently have the capability to measure the atmospheric precipitable water vapor content and water vapor constraints cannot be guaranteed and will be treated on a best-efforts basis.
