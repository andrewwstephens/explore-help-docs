# Image Quality

The image quality constraint is the **on-source** image quality in arcseconds **as measured at the science wavelength**.

Image quality < 0.1" implies adaptive optics ([Altair](https://www.gemini.edu/instrumentation/altair) or [GeMS](https://www.gemini.edu/instrumentation/gems)) at infrared wavelengths and speckle imaging ([Alopke or Zorro](https://www.gemini.edu/instrumentation/alopeke-zorro)) at optical wavelengths.

Note that the seeing is a function of airmass, and requesting very good seeing conditions may limit an observation's schedulability.
