# Image Quality

The image quality constraint is the **on-source** image quality in arcseconds **as measured at the science wavelength**.
Image quality < 0.1" implies adaptive optics (at infrared wavelengths) or speckle imaging (at optical wavelengths).

Note that the seeing is a function of airmass, and requesting very good seeing conditions will limit an observation's schedulability.
