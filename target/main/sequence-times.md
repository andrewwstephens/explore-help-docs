# Sequence Times

The title bar of the Sequence panel displays three observation times:

The **Planned** time is the total time that will be charged to the program for the observation.
This includes acquisitions and _program_ calibrations.
This does _not_ include partner calibrations such as GMOS flats and arcs.

The **Executed** time is the time that has been charged to the program.

The **Pending** time is the Planned time minus the Executed time.
